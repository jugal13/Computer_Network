## Programs

### NS3
1. [Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.](ns3&#32;Programs/1.cc)
2. [Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP agent between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents by changing the parameters and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.](ns3&#32;Programs/2.cc)
3. [Simulate simple Extended Service Set with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.](ns3&#32;Programs/3.cc)
4. [Simulate a wireless network, generate traffic and analyze its performance.](ns3&#32;Programs/4.cc)
5. [Simulate a transmission of ping message over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.](ns3&#32;Programs/5.cc)

### Programs
1. [Write a program for error detection using CRC-CCITT (16-bits).](Programs/crc.cpp)
2. [Write a program to generate Hamming Code for error detection and correction.](Programs/hamming.cpp)
3. [Write a client-server program using TCP/IP sockets in which client requests for a file by sending the file name to the server, and the server sends back the contents of the requested file if present.](Programs/Q3)
4. [Write a program to implement traffic policing using Leaky bucket algorithm.](Programs/leakybucket.c)
