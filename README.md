## Programs

### NS3
    1. Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
    2. Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP agent between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents by changing the parameters and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP.
    3. Simulate simple Extended Service Set with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.
    4. Simulate a wireless network, generate traffic and analyze its performance.
    5. Simulate a transmission of ping message over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

### Programs
    1. Write a program for error detection using CRC-CCITT (16-bits).
    2. Write a program to generate Hamming Code for error detection and correction.
    3. Write a client-server program using TCP/IP sockets in which client requests for a file by sending the file name to the server, and the server sends back the contents of the requested file if present.
    4. Write a program to implement traffic policing using Leaky bucket algorithm.
